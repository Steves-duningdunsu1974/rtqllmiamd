Wow. I just walked out of Contraataque, still hearing the rumble of battles in my bones like war drum echoes in a canyon. Can hardly remember my name right now—so excuse typos and all, theater was loud, way too teenagers around. Seats weren’t made for people over 5’7” I swear, now my back’s doing this weird accordion thing. Popcorn tastes like cardboard, or is it my tongue?

Anyway, the movie. It started with this zoologist (go figure, right? Projection much? Ha) deep in the Amazon—not the website, the jungle—surrounded by snakes and parrots giving sass like they're auditioning for a side gig in a sitcom. Oddly reminded me of my mother-in-law. Vibrant but wild, unpredictable like a hurricane in a bottle. Scenes zip through faster than a cheetah on rollerblades, had to remind myself to actually breathe. 

> There’s this electrifying sequence where the zoologist’s cat (didn’t know about the cat until mid-way, maybe it was in the opening, got distracted by someone spilling nachos) somehow hacks into a mainframe using little paws and attitude. Felt like watching my tax accountant explaining numbers. Utter confusion yet hypnotizing.

The soundtrack blared, some sort of a tribal trance thingy, wrapping scenes in this blanket of organized chaos. I was trying to remember if you’re supposed to download the movie later or what, too noisy to think. Even had a moment—brief like lightning—where I was sure the lion on screen arched an eyebrow at the protagonist like, “Dude, what are we even doing here?” Classic feline.

My head’s still in that scene with the subterranean cave crammed with luminescent bats, like tiny glowing fruitcakes with wings. I swear I tasted purple. Just what you want from a film, illusion stronger than reality itself. Must rewatch once it’s out for streaming, to catch whatever it was I missed—keep whispering download the movie under my breath, hoping not to forget.

Oh, and there was this confrontation with the villain—a biochemist gone rogue—whose plan was to, I don’t know, mutate sugar? Something diabolical but really specific, essence of future nightmares. Feel dazed thinking about it. Or maybe that’s from lack of sitting properly.
